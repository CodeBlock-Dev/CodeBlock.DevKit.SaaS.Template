## üîß Build, Deploy and Maintenance

This template includes comprehensive build automation that covers compilation, linting, and testing. The build system is already integrated into the CI workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

#### Local Build Scripts

For convenience, we've provided scripts to run build tasks locally:

| Script Location | Purpose |
|----------------|----------|
| `src/4-Build/scripts/compile/` | Builds the entire solution |
| `src/4-Build/scripts/lint/` | Runs code quality checks |
| `src/4-Build/scripts/tests/` | Executes unit and integration tests |
| `src/4-Build/scripts/packages/` | Updates CodeBlock Dev Kit NuGet packages |

For detailed build system documentation, see the [Build README](src/4-Build/README.md).

#### CI/CD Configuration

- **CI Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Pre-configured to build, test, and package your application
- **CD Workflow** (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`): Configured for Windows IIS deployment

You can modify these workflows based on your deployment environment. The template is not limited to any specific platform - you can deploy to cloud services, Linux servers, Windows servers, or any other environment of your choice.

For detailed CI/CD guidance, refer to the [CodeBlock Dev Kit Documentation](https://docs.codeblock.dev/).

The template includes a complete example implementation to help you understand how to build your own features.
- Run the `src/2-Clients/Api` project and see `DemocThings` APIs.
- Run the `src/2-Clients/AdminPanel` project and navigate to `Demo` menu item.
- Look at the code in the `src/1-Libraries/Application/Services/DemoThings` to see how the application services are structured.
- Look at `src/1-Libraries/Application/UseCases/DemoThings/` to see how the use cases are implemented.
- Look at the `src/1-Libraries/Core/Domain/DemoThings/` to see how the domain logic is structured.
- Look at the `src/3-Tests/Application.Tests.Unit/UseCases/DemoThings/` to see how unit tests are written.
- Look at the `src/3-Tests/Application.Tests.Integration/UseCases/DemoThings/` to see how integration tests are structured.

For detailed guidance on implementing features and customizing the template, refer to the [CodeBlock Dev Kit Documentation](https://docs.codeblock.dev/).
