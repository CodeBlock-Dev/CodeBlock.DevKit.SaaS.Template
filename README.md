## üîß Build, Deploy and Maintenance

This template includes comprehensive build automation using the [NUKE](https://nuke.build/) build system. You can easily user them in your [CI/CD](.github/workflows) pipelines or run them locally.



| Location | Purpose |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| `src/4-Build/scripts/compile/` | Builds the entire solution |
| `src/4-Build/scripts/lint/` | Runs code quality checks |
| `src/4-Build/scripts/tests/` | Executes unit and integration tests |
| `src/4-Build/scripts/packages/` | Updates CodeBlock Dev Kit NuGet packages |

### Running Build Scripts

For detailed information about the build system, see the [Build README](src/4-Build/README.md).

### Continuous Integration & Deployment

The template includes pre-configured CI/CD workflows:

- **CI Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Builds, tests, and packages your application
- **CD Workflow** (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`): Deploys to Windows IIS server

**Customizing for Your Environment:**

1. **Modify CI Workflow**: Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to match your build requirements
2. **Configure CD Workflow**: Customize `.github/workflows/cd.yml` for your deployment target:
   - For Linux deployment: Change runner to `ubuntu-latest`
   - For cloud deployment: Update deployment steps for your cloud provider
   - For different platforms: Modify build commands and artifact packaging
