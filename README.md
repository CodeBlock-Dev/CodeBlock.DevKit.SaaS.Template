2. Go to your [dashboard](https://codeblock.dev/dashboard) and download your license file (`codeblock.dev.license.lic`).
3. Copy the license file to the root directory of this template project
4. Execute the setup script to configure your SaaS application

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Do not share your license publicly. If your repository is public, add the license to your .gitignore file to prevent it from being uploaded.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup the Template

The template includes automated setup scripts for different operating systems:

- **Minimum Version**: 4.4+
- **Download**: [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- **Connection**: Default connection is `mongodb://localhost:27017` in all `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json` files. If you change the default port while installing MongoDB server, remember to update the connection in appsettings files as well.
- **Run as service**: The MongoDB server needs to be running as a service on your server or PC.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: For security reasons, do not use the default connection in production and use username/password authentication for your MongoDB connection

- **Connection**: Default connection is `http://localhost:6334` in all `appsettings.json` files
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Change default connection in production
- **Note**: Only required if your application includes AI chatbot functionality

**Configuration**: After installation, update connection strings in all client projects (`AdminPanel`, `Api`, `WebApp`) `appsettings.json` files if you change from defaults.

# üöÄ Implement Your Logic and Build Your SaaS

The template includes a complete example implementation called 'DemocThings' to help you understand how to build your own features.
- Run the `src/2-Clients/Api` project and see `DemocThings` APIs.
- Run the `src/2-Clients/AdminPanel` project and navigate to `Demo` menu item.
- Look at the code in the `src/1-Libraries/Application/Services/DemoThings` to see how the application services are structured.
- Look at `src/1-Libraries/Application/UseCases/DemoThings/` to see how the use cases are implemented.
- Look at the `src/1-Libraries/Core/Domain/DemoThings/` to see how the domain logic is structured.
- Look at the `src/3-Tests/Application.Tests.Unit/UseCases/DemoThings/` to see how unit tests are written.
- Look at the `src/3-Tests/Application.Tests.Integration/UseCases/DemoThings/` to see how integration tests are structured.

For detailed guidance on implementing features and customizing the template, refer to the [CodeBlock DevKit Documentation](https://docs.codeblock.dev/).

**üí° AI Coding Tip**: When using AI coding agents (like GitHub Copilot, Cursor), you can reference the `DemoThings` sample implementation to help the AI understand your project's architecture and coding patterns. This sample serves as a great example for the AI model to follow when implementing similar features in your SaaS application.

# üîß Build, Deploy and Maintenance

This template includes comprehensive build automation that covers compilation, linting, and testing. The build system is already integrated into the CI workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

#### Local Build Scripts

For convenience, we've provided scripts to run build tasks locally:

| Script Location | Purpose |
|----------------|----------|
| `src/4-Build/scripts/compile/` | Builds the entire solution |
| `src/4-Build/scripts/lint/` | Runs code quality checks |
| `src/4-Build/scripts/tests/` | Executes unit and integration tests |
| `src/4-Build/scripts/packages/` | UpdatesCodeBlock DevKit NuGet packages |

For detailed build system documentation, see the [Build README](src/4-Build/README.md).

#### CI/CD Configuration

- **CI Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Pre-configured to build, test, and package your application
- **CD Workflow** (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`): Configured for Windows IIS deployment

You can modify these workflows based on your deployment environment. The template is not limited to any specific platform - you can deploy to cloud services, Linux servers, Windows servers, or any other environment of your choice.

For detailed CI/CD guidance, refer to the [CodeBlock DevKit Documentation](https://docs.codeblock.dev/).

# ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Required Services

After setting up and running the template, you need to configure essential services in the admin panel to ensure all pre-built modules work correctly and provide a complete user experience.

#### Access the Settings Page
1. Run the `AdminPanel` project
2. Navigate to the **Settings** page in the admin panel
3. Configure the following three service providers:

#### Email Service Configuration
- **Purpose**: Required for user registration, password reset, and notification emails
- **Recommended**: [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) (suggested for production)
- **Alternatives**: 
  - [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)
  - Self-hosted email server
- **Setup**: Configure email settings with your chosen provider's credentials

#### SMS Service Configuration
- **Purpose**: Required for two-factor authentication and SMS notifications
- **Recommended**: [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)
- **Setup**: Add your Twilio Account SID, Auth Token, and phone number

#### Payment Service Configuration
- **Purpose**: Required for subscription management and payment processing
- **Recommended**: [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- **Setup**: 
  1. Create a [Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)
  2. Configure payment settings with your Stripe API keys (Publishable Key and Secret Key)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: These services are essential for the template to function properly. Without proper configuration, features like user authentication, notifications, and subscription management will not work correctly.
